// SUMMARY
/*
WHAT IS AN EXPRESSION?
WHAT IS A STATEMENT?

program built with statements,
which can contain more statements.
statements tend to contain expressions,
which can be build out of smaller expressions.

putting statements together gives you a program
that is executed from top to bottom.

you can change control flow
with conditional (if, else, switch),
looping (while, do, for) statements

bindings to file pieces of data under one name
useful for tracking state of program
environment is the set of bindings that are defined

functions are special bindings that encapsulate a piece of program
invoke them with function(). such a function call is an expression
